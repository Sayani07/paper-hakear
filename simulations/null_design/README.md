**Objective:** 1. Behavior of wpd under different null designs N(0,1), N(5, 1), N(0,5) and N(5,5), Gamma(0,1), Gamma(0,5) for different nx and nfacets. Here, we have to fix a value of lambda = 0.67.

**Assumptions:** There is no difference in distribution between any facet or x-category
nsim = 200
lambda = 0.67

**Questions:** 
- How raw value of wpd changes with different nx and nfacet for different location and scale of a Normal and non-normal distribution
